				<p>Single Player level made with Unreal Engine for University purposes.</p>
				<h1>
					Context given:
				</h1>
				<p>
					The player must  be introduced to the basic mechanics of walking,
					running, crouching and jumping. The level must also include a puzzle. It
					should take 5 to 10 minutes to play through the level.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is to be a first person action game centred around the character
					of Derek Dury, a Glaswegian security guard and army reservist who gets
					caught up in a drug deal gone wrong. The overall game arc sees Derek
					mistakenly identified as having stolen £500k from Glafia (the Glasgow
					Mafia) and follows his journey of escaping their grasp and ultimately
					wreaking revenge on two corrupt police officers (Sergeants MacGregor
					and Toshan) who actually stole the money and who leaked the rumour
					about Derek. The game’s tone is somewhere between Breaking Bad
					and The Sopranos, by way of the Punisher and The Bill. The game’s
					desired play experience is fast paced cover based combat mixed with
					stealth sections and occasional puzzles aimed at breaking up the
					combat and giving the player a chance to use a different set of skills
					rather than being 100% intense shooting 100% of the time.
